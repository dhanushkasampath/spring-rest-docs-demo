Let's see how to document our rest api using "Spring REST Docs"

Why not swagger?
===============

Because its a 3rd party tool and it has some limitations

Eg:
Swagger can not handle models which have circular dependencies


Spring REST Docs helps to produce documentation to your endpoints which are accurate and concise.
